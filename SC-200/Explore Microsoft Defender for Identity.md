# Summary

## Introduction 

This page introducing [[Defender for Identity]] and the APT connector that has to be installed on the On-Prem AD Server.

## Process flow for Defender for Identity

There are three main components for MDI. The Cloud Portal, On-Prem Connector, and the Cloud Service that Microsoft provides. 

The Cloud Portal I'm very familiar with. 

The On-Prem Connector can be installed on Domain Controllers or Active Directory Federated Services servers. 

The cloud services is just the backend bit's and bob's that Microsoft has programed to work for this purpose.
